# Live Cricket Win Probability Model
This project aimed to produce a live win probability model for Twenty20 cricket. The model can be used to follow any live match and return a live win probability, along with a win probability graph covering the current duration of the game.

## Setup
To run the code, clone the repo and install the following dependencies:
* dash==2.6.1
* dash_daq==0.5.0
* ipython==8.5.0
* matplotlib==3.5.2
* numpy==1.21.4
* pandas==1.3.4
* plotly==5.10.0
* requests==2.28.1
* scikit_learn==1.1.2
* seaborn==0.11.2
* xgboost==1.6.1

Python version 3.8.13 was used to run the code.

## Usage
With the repo cloned, to follow a live match whilst using the model, open and work through the `Framework.ipynb` notebook.
